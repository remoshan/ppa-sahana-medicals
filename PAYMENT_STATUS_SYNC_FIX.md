# Payment Status Update Fix - Order Management

## 🎯 Issue Fixed

**Problem:** Admin could update payment status in the Payment Management page, but when updating it in Order Management, it didn't sync properly between the `orders` and `customer_payments` tables.

**Solution:** Implemented bi-directional synchronization between order payment status and customer payment records.

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Orders Management Page** (`admin/orders.php`)
- ✅ Payment status dropdown **already existed** in the table
- ✅ Now **syncs to `customer_payments` table** when changed
- ✅ Maps status values correctly (`paid` ↔ `completed`)
- ✅ Added **color-coded borders** for visual clarity
- ✅ Added **emoji indicators** for better UX
- ✅ Added **confirmation dialog** before updating
- ✅ Added **loading indicator** during update

### 2. **Payment Management Page** (`admin/payments.php`)
- ✅ Already synced to `orders` table
- ✅ Enhanced to map status values correctly
- ✅ Updated success message to indicate both tables updated

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### **Updating from Orders Management:**
```
Admin changes payment status in Orders page
    ↓
Order table updated (e.g., 'paid')
    ↓
Status mapped for customer_payments ('paid' → 'completed')
    ↓
Customer_payments table updated
    ↓
✅ Both tables in sync!
```

### **Updating from Payment Management:**
```
Admin changes payment status in Payments page
    ↓
Customer_payments table updated (e.g., 'completed')
    ↓
Status mapped for orders ('completed' → 'paid')
    ↓
Orders table updated
    ↓
✅ Both tables in sync!
```

## 📊 Payment Status Values

### **Orders Table:**
- `pending` - Payment not yet received
- `paid` - Payment completed
- `failed` - Payment attempt failed
- `refunded` - Payment was refunded

### **Customer_Payments Table:**
- `pending` - Payment not yet received
- `completed` - Payment completed *(mapped to `paid` in orders)*
- `failed` - Payment attempt failed
- `refunded` - Payment was refunded

### **Automatic Mapping:**
| Orders Status | Customer_Payments Status |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| pending      | pending                 |
| **paid**     | **completed**           |
| failed       | failed                  |
| refunded     | refunded                |
