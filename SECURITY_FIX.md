# ðŸ”’ Security Fix: Admin/Customer Session Separation

## Problem Identified
**Critical Security Vulnerability**: When an admin logged in, customers could access the admin panel using the same browser session, and vice versa. This was a major security flaw that could allow unauthorized access to sensitive administrative functions.

## Root Cause
- Admin and customer sessions were not properly isolated
- No mechanism to clear opposing session types when logging in
- Missing security checks for cross-session access
- Insufficient authentication validation on admin pages

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Session Clearing on Login**

#### Admin Login (`admin/login.php`)
- When admin logs in, the entire session is destroyed and recreated
- All customer session variables are explicitly cleared:
  - `user_logged_in`
  - `user_id`
  - `user_name`
  - `user_email`
  - `cart`

#### Customer Login (`auth.php`)
- When customer logs in, all admin session variables are cleared:
  - `admin_logged_in`
  - `admin_id`
  - `admin_username`
  - `admin_role`
  - `admin_name`

### 2. **Enhanced Authentication Check (`admin/auth_check.php`)**

Created a centralized authentication file that:
- âœ… Verifies admin is logged in
- âœ… Checks if customer session exists (security breach)
- âœ… Validates all required admin session variables
- âœ… Destroys session and redirects if any security issues detected
- âœ… Prevents customers from accessing admin panel

### 3. **Updated All Admin Pages**

Modified all admin pages to use the new secure authentication:
- `admin/index.php`
- `admin/medicines.php`
- `admin/categories.php`
- `admin/customers.php`
- `admin/orders.php`
- `admin/prescriptions.php`
- `admin/staff.php`

### 4. **Apache Security Configuration (`admin/.htaccess`)**

Added `.htaccess` file with:
- Directory browsing disabled
- Protection for sensitive files
- Direct access to `auth_check.php` blocked
- Secure session cookie settings
- XSS and clickjacking protection
- Custom security headers

### 5. **Security Test Script (`test_security.php`)**

Created a testing tool to verify:
- Session separation is working
- Only one session type can be active
- Cross-session access is prevented
- Proper session clearing on login/logout

## How It Works

### When Admin Logs In:
1. Session is completely destroyed
2. New session is created
3. Admin session variables are set
4. All customer session variables are explicitly removed
5. User is redirected to admin panel

### When Customer Logs In:
1. All admin session variables are removed
2. Customer session variables are set
3. User is redirected to customer area

### When Accessing Admin Panel:
1. `auth_check.php` verifies admin is logged in
2. If customer session is detected â†’ **SECURITY BREACH**
3. Session is destroyed and redirected to login
4. Error message is shown

### When Accessing Customer Area:
- Admin can access but will see customer view (not logged in)
- No customer features available to admin
- Admin must logout and login as customer to use customer features

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Customer â†’ Admin Access
1. Login as customer
2. Try to access `admin/index.php`
3. **Expected**: Redirected to admin login page

### Test 2: Admin â†’ Customer Login
1. Login as admin
2. Login as customer in another tab
3. Check admin panel
4. **Expected**: Admin session cleared, must re-login

### Test 3: Customer â†’ Admin Login
1. Login as customer
2. Login as admin
3. Check `test_security.php`
4. **Expected**: Only admin session active

### Test 4: Session Isolation
1. Run `test_security.php`
2. Login as either admin or customer
3. Refresh test page
4. **Expected**: Only ONE session type active

## Security Benefits

âœ… **Complete Session Isolation**: Admin and customer sessions cannot coexist  
âœ… **Automatic Session Clearing**: Logging in as one type clears the other  
âœ… **Multi-Layer Protection**: Multiple security checks at different levels  
âœ… **Breach Detection**: Automatic detection and prevention of security issues  
âœ… **Apache-Level Security**: Additional protection via `.htaccess`  
âœ… **Centralized Authentication**: Easy to maintain and update  
âœ… **Error Logging Ready**: Can enable database verification if needed  

## Files Modified

### Core Files:
- âœ… `admin/login.php` - Enhanced admin login with session clearing
- âœ… `auth.php` - Enhanced customer login with admin session clearing
- âœ… `admin/auth_check.php` - NEW: Centralized security check

### Admin Pages Updated:
- âœ… `admin/index.php`
- âœ… `admin/medicines.php`
- âœ… `admin/categories.php`
- âœ… `admin/customers.php`
- âœ… `admin/orders.php`
- âœ… `admin/prescriptions.php`
- âœ… `admin/staff.php`

### Security Files:
- âœ… `admin/.htaccess` - NEW: Apache security configuration
- âœ… `test_security.php` - NEW: Security testing tool

## Maintenance

### To Add New Admin Page:
1. Include `auth_check.php` after session_start()
2. No additional code needed

```php
<?php
session_start();
include '../config/database.php';

// Secure authentication check
include 'auth_check.php';

// Your page code here...
?>
```

### To Enable Database Verification:
Uncomment the database check section in `admin/auth_check.php` to verify admin status in real-time.

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Use HTTPS**: Always use SSL/TLS in production
2. **Session Timeout**: Implement automatic logout after inactivity
3. **IP Validation**: Consider adding IP address validation
4. **Audit Logging**: Log all admin access for security audits
5. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Consider implementing 2FA for admin accounts
6. **Regular Security Audits**: Periodically review and test security measures

## Status

ðŸ”’ **SECURITY VULNERABILITY FIXED**

The system now properly isolates admin and customer sessions, preventing unauthorized cross-access between user types.
