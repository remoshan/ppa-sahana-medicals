# Prescription Management Update

## Changes Made

### Removed "Add Prescription" Functionality

**Reason:** Prescriptions should only be submitted by customers through the customer portal, not created by admins.

### What Was Removed:

1. **"Add Prescription" Button**
   - Removed from the admin header in prescription management page
   - Updated description to "Review and manage customer prescription submissions"

2. **Edit Button**
   - Removed the edit button from action buttons in the table
   - Kept only "View" and "Delete" buttons
   - Added text labels to buttons for clarity

3. **Prescription Modal**
   - Removed entire create/edit modal form
   - This modal allowed admins to create/edit prescriptions
   - No longer needed since prescriptions come from customers

4. **JavaScript Functions**
   - Removed `openModal()` function
   - Removed `addMedicine()` function  
   - Removed `removeMedicine()` function
   - These were only used for the create/edit modal

5. **Backend Handlers**
   - Removed `case 'create'` from POST handler
   - Removed `case 'update'` from POST handler
   - Kept only `update_status` and `delete` actions
   - Added comment explaining prescriptions are customer-created

### What Remains:

✅ **View Prescription Details** - View full prescription information  
✅ **Update Status** - Change prescription status (pending/approved/rejected/filled/cancelled)  
✅ **Rejection Reasons** - Provide reason when rejecting a prescription  
✅ **Delete Prescription** - Remove prescription if needed  
✅ **Search & Filter** - Find prescriptions by customer or status  

### Result:

The admin prescription management page now focuses on **reviewing and managing** customer-submitted prescriptions rather than creating them. This maintains proper workflow:

1. **Customer** → Submits prescription with image
2. **Admin** → Reviews submission
3. **Admin** → Approves/Rejects with reason
4. **Admin** → Marks as filled when processed

This is the correct pharmacy workflow where prescriptions originate from customers/patients.
