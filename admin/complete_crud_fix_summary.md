2. Form ID on delete modal form  
3. AJAX event listeners that:
   - Prevent default form submission
   - Append 'table' parameter
   - Send to ajax_handler.php
   - Show toast on success/error
   - Reload page after 1 second

## Backend (ajax_handler.php):
All handlers properly support:
- create
- update  
- delete
