# Cart Persistence & Admin Cache Fix

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Cart Persistence Issue** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** When a customer added items to cart and logged out, their cart was lost. After logging back in, cart was empty.

**Solution:** Implemented database-backed cart storage that persists across sessions.

### 2. **Admin Panel Cache Issue** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** When customers updated their information or placed orders, admin couldn't see the changes unless they logged out and logged back in.

**Solution:** Added cache control headers to prevent browser and server caching on admin pages.

## 📋 Installation Steps

### Step 1: Run Cart Database Schema
Execute the SQL file to create the cart table:

```bash
# In phpMyAdmin or MySQL command line:
mysql -u root -p PPA_Sahana_Medicals < config/cart_schema.sql
```

Or manually:
1. Open phpMyAdmin
2. Select database: `PPA_Sahana_Medicals`
3. Go to SQL tab
4. Copy and paste contents of `config/cart_schema.sql`
5. Click "Go"

### Step 2: Verify Table Created
Check that the `cart` table exists with these columns:
- `id` (INT, AUTO_INCREMENT, PRIMARY KEY)
- `customer_id` (INT, FOREIGN KEY to customers)
- `medicine_id` (INT, FOREIGN KEY to medicines)
- `quantity` (INT)
- `price` (DECIMAL)
- `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)
- `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP)

## 🔄 How Cart Persistence Works

### **Old Flow (Session-Only):**
```
Customer logs in
    ↓
Adds items to cart (stored in PHP session)
    ↓
Logs out → Session destroyed → Cart lost ❌
    ↓
Logs back in → Empty cart
```

### **New Flow (Database-Backed):**
```
Customer logs in
    ↓
Previous cart loaded from database ✅
    ↓
Adds items to cart
    ├─ Saved to database
    └─ Updated in session
    ↓
Logs out → Session destroyed, but cart saved in database ✅
    ↓
Logs back in → Cart loaded from database ✅
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Cart Persistence
1. Login as a customer
2. Add 2-3 medicines to cart
3. View cart to confirm items are there
4. **Logout**
5. **Login again**
6. ✅ **Cart should still have the same items**

### Test 2: Cart Updates Persist
1. Login as a customer
2. Add items to cart
3. Update quantities in cart
4. Logout and login
5. ✅ **Updated quantities should be preserved**

### Test 3: Cart Clears After Checkout
1. Login as a customer
2. Add items to cart
3. Complete checkout process
4. ✅ **Cart should be empty after successful order**

### Test 4: Admin Cache Fix
1. Open admin panel in browser
2. Open customer website in another tab
3. As customer: update profile or place order
4. Go back to admin panel
5. Refresh the page (F5)
6. ✅ **Admin should see the updates immediately** (no logout required)

### Test 5: Multiple Browser Sessions
1. Login as customer in Chrome
2. Add items to cart in Chrome
3. Logout from Chrome
4. Login as same customer in Firefox
5. ✅ **Cart should have the same items in Firefox**

## 📊 Database Structure

### Cart Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE cart (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT NOT NULL,
    medicine_id INT NOT NULL,
    quantity INT NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (medicine_id) REFERENCES medicines(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    UNIQUE KEY unique_customer_medicine (customer_id, medicine_id)
);
```

**Key Points:**
- Each customer can only have ONE entry per medicine (UNIQUE constraint)
- If customer is deleted, their cart is automatically deleted (CASCADE)
- If medicine is deleted, cart entries are removed (CASCADE)
- `updated_at` automatically updates on any change

## 🔒 Security Enhancements

### Cache Control Headers Added:
```php
Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate
Pragma: no-cache
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
```

### Benefits:
- **Prevents data leaks** from browser cache
- **Protects against XSS attacks**
- **Prevents clickjacking**
- **Ensures fresh data** on every page load
- **Improved security** for admin panel

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Cart items not persisting:
1. Verify `cart` table was created: `SHOW TABLES LIKE 'cart';`
2. Check for errors in browser console
3. Ensure customer is logged in before adding to cart
4. Check database foreign keys are intact

### Admin still seeing old data:
1. Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
2. Clear browser cache completely
3. Try in incognito/private mode
4. Check if `cache_control.php` is being included

### Cart not clearing after checkout:
1. Check if `DELETE FROM cart WHERE customer_id = ?` executed
2. Review checkout.php for any rollback issues
3. Check database permissions

## 📝 Developer Notes

### Adding to Cart:
```php
// Old way (session only) - NO LONGER USED
$_SESSION['cart'][] = $item;

// New way (database + session)
$stmt = $pdo->prepare("INSERT INTO cart ...");
loadCartFromDatabase($pdo, $customer_id);
```

### Loading Cart on Login:
```php
// In auth.php after successful login:
$stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT c.*, m.name, m.quantity as max_quantity FROM cart c JOIN medicines m...");
$cart_items = $stmt->fetchAll();
$_SESSION['cart'] = $cart_items;
```

### Clearing Cart:
```php
// After checkout:
$stmt = $pdo->prepare("DELETE FROM cart WHERE customer_id = ?");
unset($_SESSION['cart']);
```
